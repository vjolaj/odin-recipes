    <p> <h3> Description:</h3> </p>
    <p>Birria is a Mexican dish from the state of Jalisco. It is a traditional soup or stew made from a combination of chili pepper-based goat meat adobo, garlic, cumin, bay leaves, and thyme, and cooked at a low heat. Birria is slow-stewed in a pot, and differs from barbacoa, which is cooked underground.</p>
