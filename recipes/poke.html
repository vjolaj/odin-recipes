    <p> <h3> Description:</h3> </p>
    <p> In Hawaiian culinary traditions, “poke” literally means to cut something. Poke bowls are highly customizable, which allows for better choices based on your personal preferences. Poke bowl nutrition is derived from the base ingredient, protein items, sauces and toppings. A poke bowl base usually consists of rice, with protein choices of tuna, tofu, salmon and many more options. Sauces are an essential part of a poke bowl and can consist of wasabi mayo, eel sauce and dragon aioli. Poke bowl toppings are the last step and usually include crispy onions, cherry tomatoes, avocados, cashews and more.</p>
